# Tranzit
*CS 307 Project*

A package processing application.

## Directory Structure
`app`: Client-side stuff.
`assets`: Graphic resources, most likely images.
`config`: Server configuration files, can be anything you need.
`gulp`: Build scripts.
`server`: Server-side stuff.
`test`: Unit tests for everything.

## Getting Started
You will need to install Node.js first. You can find instructions here: [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)

Then, install Gulp.js:
```
$ sudo -H npm i -g gulp
```

Clone the repo, then install dependencies by running from project root:
```
$ npm i
```

At this point, project does not have a build script. I will post build script documentation as soon as I set it up.
