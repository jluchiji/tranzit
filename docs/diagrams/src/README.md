# Tranzit - Diagram Sources
Diagrams are generated from these sources by [mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/) library.
If you want to edit these, you can use the online renderer [mscgen.js](https://sverweij.github.io/mscgen_js/).
Please note that `mscgen.js` generates invalid SVG files, therefore `mscgen` is still required for generating `.eps` files.
